Template for Cookie Cutter template post on [blog.elyssonmr.com](https://blog.elyssonmr.com)

## How to use it

Before running, make sure to have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed.

Then make sure to have [Cookie Cutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) installed, then you just need to run:

```sh
$ cookiecutter https://github.com/elyssonmr/fastapi-template.git
```

Fill the required prompt (there is some examples and default values). Now you have a new project configured for you.

At the end run `poetry install` just to make sure that everything is installed correctly.

I hope you enjoy the article and this template helps you in future projects.
